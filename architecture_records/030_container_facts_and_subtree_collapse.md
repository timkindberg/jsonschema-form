# ADR 030: Container Facts — Generalizing the Neutral Waist so `present()` Can Collapse a Subtree into One Widget

**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Status:** Proposed (bd `fcj`)
**Deciders:** Tim Kindberg
**Extends:** ADR 029 (§1 `FieldFacts` → a node-level `NodeFacts` waist; resolves the
deferred `valueShape: 'object'` member of §1)
**Relates to:** ADR 006 (IR waist), ADR 008 (a second implementation earns the seam),
ADR 010/013 (the continuation `control` facet / render dispatch), ADR 011 (form-state
shallow slot; submit assembly), ADR 018 (sparse array paths / submit)

## Context

ADR 029 made presentation its own stage: the parser emits neutral **`FieldFacts`** on
each leaf, and a pure `present()` stage assigns a widget + derives control parts via a
layered `PresentationResolver`. That resolver is the seam a consumer uses to say "render
*this* node as *that* widget" for schemas it does not control — the whole point of the
ADR.

But the seam only reaches **leaves**. Two facts about the code today:

1. **`FieldFacts` is leaf-only.** It lives on `FieldNode` (`nodeTypes.ts`); `present()`
   calls `presentField` only when `node.isField` and otherwise just recurses into
   `children` (`present.ts`). `ArrayNode` and `GroupNode` carry **no facts**.
2. **A resolver therefore cannot opt a *container subtree* into a single widget.** A
   `PresentationResolver` is `(facts: FieldFacts) => Presentation | undefined` — it is
   never handed a container, so there is nothing to match on and no node to rewrite.

What this blocks — the canonical case (the VNDLY primary-multiselect pattern):

```jsonc
// allowed_criteria: choose N criteria objects from a remote list
{
  "type": "array",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": { "name": { "type": "string" }, "type": { "type": "string" } }
  }
}
```

Today this parses to an **`ArrayNode`** (an add/remove list of object sub-forms). The
product wants a consumer to be able to present it as **one multiselect** producing
`Array<{ name, type }>` — no schema edit, no add/remove UI. There is no seam for that,
because the `ArrayNode` has no facts to resolve over.

The mirror gap is object subtrees: a `GroupNode` (e.g. an address, a date-range) that a
consumer wants to collapse into **one** control that owns the whole `{ … }` value. ADR
029 §1 anticipated exactly this and **deferred `valueShape: 'object'`** until "such a
widget earns it," noting it "requires `present()` to collapse a `GroupNode` subtree into
one widget node — a separate, undesigned capability." **This ADR designs that
capability** and, with it, earns `valueShape: 'object'`.

## Decision

### 1. `FieldFacts` generalizes to a node-level `NodeFacts` waist

Facts become a property of **every** node — leaves *and* containers — not just leaves.
Leaves keep exactly today's facts; containers gain facts that describe the value the
subtree submits. The neutral waist (ADR 006) now spans the whole tree, so the resolver
can match a container the same way it matches a leaf.

```ts
type ValueShape = 'scalar' | 'array' | 'object'

interface NodeFacts {
  path: string
  label: string
  description?: string
  required: boolean
  valueShape: ValueShape
  constraints: ValidationRules
  attrs: { id: string; name: string }
  origin: { source: string; schema: unknown } // front-end-owned (ADR 029 §2)
}

// today's FieldFacts, unchanged in meaning
interface LeafFacts extends NodeFacts {
  primitive: 'string' | 'number' | 'integer' | 'boolean'
  format?: string
  choices?: SelectOption[]
}

// projected onto ArrayNode / GroupNode
interface ContainerFacts extends NodeFacts {
  choices?: SelectOption[]        // present only when the schema constrains a finite set
  item?: ItemDescriptor           // the neutral shape of one element (open-ended sources)
}
```

`ItemDescriptor` is the minimum neutral description of a single element (e.g. its member
keys + primitives) — enough for a resolver to name a value/label identity **without**
reading `origin.schema`. Its precise shape is settled by the first two consumers (ADR
008); it is deliberately thin here.

### 2. `valueShape` is the shape of the *submitted value*, independent of decomposition

This is the load-bearing invariant. `valueShape` describes what the node contributes to
the submitted document, **whether or not it is currently decomposed into children**:

| node today | `valueShape` | decomposed now? |
|---|---|---|
| scalar leaf | `scalar` | — |
| leaf enum-array (`multiselect`) | `array` | no (already one control) |
| **subtree array** (`items:object`) | `array` | yes (add/remove) — *collapsible* |
| **object subtree** (`GroupNode`) | `object` | yes (nested fields) — *collapsible* |

A leaf enum-array and a *collapsed* object-array **both** report `valueShape: 'array'`
and stay consistent. This resolves ADR 029's deferred member: `'object'` is the
submitted shape of an object-collapsing widget.

### 3. Generalizing facts to containers is a safe no-op by default

The shipped `defaultPresentation` keys multiselect off **`valueShape === 'array' &&
choices`** (ADR 029). A subtree array has `valueShape: 'array'` but **no `choices`** (it
has an `item` descriptor instead), so the default rule yields nothing for it and it
**stays an add/remove `ArrayNode`**. An object subtree (`valueShape: 'object'`, no
`choices`) likewise stays decomposed. So projecting facts onto containers changes no
default output — `present(tree, defaultPresentation)` remains identity-preserving across
the whole container matrix, exactly as ADR 029's default is for leaves. Conformance
proves it by folding the default over the existing container schemas.

Collapse happens **only** when a consumer resolver explicitly returns a widget for a
container node.

### 4. Finite `choices` vs open-ended option **source** — the source is `args`, not facts

Multiselect-over-object-array is richer than the enum case in two ways facts alone
cannot carry:

- **option source** — the options are usually remote/async (`allowed_criteria` is
  fetched), so they are *not* a static `choices` array baked into the tree; and
- **value identity** — each selection is an object `{ name, type }`; the widget needs to
  know *which* member is the submitted value and *which* is the display label.

Neither belongs in neutral facts. They are supplied by the resolver as **`args`** (the
generic per-widget config bag from ADR 029 §6, named to avoid colliding with a select's
`options`):

```ts
resolvePresentation: (facts) =>
  facts.path === 'allowed_criteria'
    ? {
        widget: 'multiselect',
        args: { optionsSource: fetchCriteria, valueKey: 'name', labelKey: 'type' },
      }
    : undefined
```

Same widget **name** (`multiselect`), divergent **facts/args** — the exact case `args`
exists for. Container **facts** carry `valueShape` + *either* `choices` (finite,
in-schema) *or* an `item` descriptor (open-ended); the resolver supplies the source via
`args`.

### 5. `present()` gains **collapse**

`present()` today offers only leaves to the resolver. It is generalized to offer
**container** nodes too, and to *collapse* one when the resolver returns a widget for it:

- prune the subtree's `children`, and
- emit a single **leaf-like control node** at the container's `path` carrying the
  container's facts (so `valueShape` is preserved), the resolved `widget`, and `args`.

Uncollapsed containers recurse exactly as today, and identity/structural-sharing is
preserved (a container whose descendants are unchanged returns itself) so the React
`NodeRenderer` memo-bail keeps holding (ADR 029 §3).

### 6. Submit assembly stays consistent for free (leaves the array hook where it is)

Submit today collects **`arrayFieldSignatures`** by walking for
`fieldNode.widget === 'multiselect'`, then `forceArrayFields` wraps a single value into a
1-element array and `unflatten` nests it (`groupNode.ts` / `groupNode.submitUtils.ts`).
Because a collapsed object-array is emitted as a **leaf-like node with `valueShape:
'array'`**, the signature walk keys on **`facts.valueShape === 'array'`** (a trivial
generalization of the `widget === 'multiselect'` check) and the *array* value assembles
with no further work — a single selection still submits as `['x']`.

The **object identity** step (mapping the submitted option values back into
`{ name, type }` objects via `valueKey`/`labelKey`) is an *additional*, resolver-declared
submit transform. It ships with the async-options capability (§7), not in the first
slice — the array-shape assembly is correct without it.

### 7. Rendering a collapsed container is gated on ADR 029 §5 (+ async options)

Drawing the collapsed control as DOM needs two things this repo has deliberately not
built yet:

- the **unified `field.control` slot** (ADR 029 §5) — today React dispatches only
  `input` vs `select` (`DefaultFieldRoot`), and the engine's `FieldPartRenderers` +
  Core's `FieldNode` union are closed to `input | select | multiselect`; and
- an **async/remote options** capability — the current `SelectFieldParts.options` is a
  static array, which cannot express `optionsSource`.

So **this ADR's scope is the tree-level contract**: the `NodeFacts` waist, container
facts, `present()` collapse, and submit array-assembly consistency — all fully testable
without a renderer (assert that `present()` collapses the subtree to one node, prunes its
children, preserves `valueShape`, and that submit yields the array). The DOM rendering of
the async object-array multiselect lands with the §5 `control` rewrite (tracked by
`jsonschema-form-cm7`) and the async-options slot.

## Migration (additive, gate-green per commit)

1. Introduce `NodeFacts` / `LeafFacts` / `ContainerFacts` (`FieldFacts` becomes
   `LeafFacts`, re-exported under the old name for one release). Project facts onto
   `ArrayNode` / `GroupNode` in the parser. **No behavior change** — the default rule
   ignores container facts that lack `choices`.
2. Generalize `present()` to offer container nodes to the resolver and to collapse when
   it returns a widget; identity-preserving; default remains a no-op. Fold `present(default)`
   over the container matrix in conformance to prove the no-op.
3. Generalize submit's array-signature collection from `widget === 'multiselect'` to
   `facts.valueShape === 'array'`.
4. **(Later, with ADR 029 §5 / `cm7`)** render the collapsed control; add the
   `optionsSource` async slot and the `valueKey`/`labelKey` submit transform.

## Consequences

- **The resolver seam becomes whole-tree.** A consumer can present *any* node — leaf or
  subtree — as any widget, directly enabling the DB-schema/no-hint story for containers,
  not just scalars.
- **`valueShape: 'object'` is earned, not speculative** (ADR 008): it arrives with the
  object-collapsing widget that needs it, and its exhaustiveness errors will pinpoint
  every site object-collapse must handle.
- **Default output is unchanged** — a pure superset; existing trees, conformance, and
  submit are untouched until a resolver opts in.
- **`args` carries source + identity, facts stay neutral** — remote/async option sources
  never pollute the front-end-agnostic waist.
- **Rendering is explicitly deferred** to the §5 control slot; the facts/collapse/submit
  contract stands alone and is independently verifiable.

## Explicit rejections

- **Put `optionsSource` / `valueKey` in facts** — rejected; the option source is
  runtime/remote and consumer-owned, not a neutral, front-end-derivable fact. It is
  `args` (ADR 029 §6).
- **A distinct `collapse: true` flag on the resolver return** — rejected; returning a
  widget for a container *is* the collapse instruction. A container that keeps its widget
  (`fieldset`/`array`) is simply not collapsed.
- **Model the collapsed array as a brand-new node kind** — rejected; it is a leaf-like
  control with `valueShape: 'array'`, so it reuses the existing submit hook and (later)
  the `multiselect` control. No new kind, no new submit path.
- **Collapse at parse time** — rejected for the same reason ADR 029 rejected resolving at
  parse time: it welds the decision to the front-end and blocks override.

## Alternatives considered

- **Leave containers factless; let consumers hijack the render imperatively** (ADR 010
  `renderNode`) — a consumer *can* already replace an `ArrayNode`'s rendered output, but
  (a) it must re-implement the widget + its options + submit wiring by hand per app, and
  (b) the submitted value would still be assembled as an add/remove array unless they
  also rewrite submit. Collapse in `present()` makes the value shape and the widget a
  single declarative decision the rest of the pipeline inherits. Rejected as the primary
  path (imperative hijack remains available for one-offs).
- **A separate `presentContainer()` resolver distinct from the leaf resolver** —
  rejected; two resolver seams double the consumer's surface for one concept ("present
  this node as that widget"). One `NodeFacts`-typed resolver covers both.

---

*This ADR is **proposed**, not accepted: it crosses the stubborn Core facts boundary
(`FieldFacts` → `NodeFacts`) and adds a capability (`valueShape: 'object'`, subtree
collapse), so it is escalated for a decision before implementation (AGENTS.md tier 3).
The accompanying `containerFacts.test.ts` pins today's behavior and records the target
contract as `it.todo` executable-spec entries so the gate stays green while the design is
reviewed.*
