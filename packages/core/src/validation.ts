// Core does not validate; it only names the shape. An adapter package (AJV, and
// later Zod/Valibot) supplies the implementation, and a consumer (React's submit
// path) runs it. These are pure types plus one pure helper — no imports, no
// state, no DOM — so the stubborn Core boundary holds while validation still
// "rides on" Core as the shared vocabulary every renderer/validator can depend on.

 * path here is what lets a renderer map an issue back to the field that owns it
 * with no translation layer. `keyword` is an optional machine code — typically
 * the JSON Schema keyword that failed (`required`, `minLength`, `pattern`).

 * **Purity invariant (ADR 025): a `Validator` MUST NOT mutate its input** (or

 * `coerceTypes`) must clone internally and validate the clone. This lets any
