// Per-path touched store (ADR 027) — the fan-out-free sibling of the ADR 023
// error store. It holds *which field paths have been touched* (focus→blur) plus
// a single `submitted` flag, and hands each field its own boolean through
// `useSyncExternalStore`. Because a field's snapshot is a primitive boolean,
// React's `Object.is` bail skips every field whose touched/submitted-derived
// state didn't change — so blurring one field re-renders only that field, and
// flipping `submitted` re-renders exactly the fields whose display state flips.
//
// Kept parallel to (not folded into) the error store on purpose (ADR 027):
// touched is monotonic per session, errors churn every validation pass. Two
// stores keep each store's invariant trivial.

/**
 * Reactive touched/submitted state, read per-field. `getTouched(path)` is a
 * bare boolean (value-compared, so no reference-stability dance is needed), and
 * `isSubmitted()` is the one-time reveal-all flag.
