 *   • **selector cascade** — the `field`/`group` registrar instead of a per-node

 *
 * The `tree` argument is a compile-time type carrier (the runtime is source-

 * may call hooks), not in rebuilding the rule set.
 *
 * OVERRIDES (bd bh7.8, resolved): if you re-present with `overrideWidgets(map)` via
 * `useFormTree`, type this hook off the returned `form` (which carries the override
 * re-narrowing) rather than the pre-override input tree — then the typed `Control`
 * is provably what renders. Typing off the pre-override tree still reflects the
 * DEFAULT presentation (correct for that tree, but not for an overridden `form`).
 *
 * ```ts
 * const tree = useMemo(() => jsonSchemaToTree(schema), [])
 * const { form } = useFormTree(tree, { resolvePresentation: overrideWidgets(MAP) })
 * const renderNode = useRenderNodeRules(form, rules)  // types track the overrides
