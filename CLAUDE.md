# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

FormFrame is a schema-driven form library built as a better-architected alternative to React JSON Schema Form (RJSF). A schema generates the form automatically; you customize in JSX, not in more schema. **Core is the form-tree IR** (intermediate representation) plus the recursive fold over it — stateless, framework-agnostic, imports nothing. Front-ends (JSON Schema and Zod today) compile *into* the tree; consumers (validation, framework binding, form-state, presentation) fold *over* it as adapters filling capability slots. React binds behavior to any compiled tree through `useFormTree(tree)` (ADR 035). See `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full model, and `architecture_records/006`–`011` for the decisions behind it. Don't describe this as "five layers" — that framing is superseded.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- `packages/core` - Headless form-tree IR, zero dependencies, no framework coupling
- `packages/react` - React adapter with hooks, default templates, and the continuation renderer
- `packages/validation-ajv` / `packages/validation-zod` - Validation adapters (maintained packages)
- `examples/basic-react` - Example app demonstrating various usage patterns
- UI/form-lib adapters (Tailwind, RHF, etc.) are reference recipes in `examples/`, not packages (ADR 024)

### Core Layer (`@formframe/core`)
Core is **stateless** — it only compiles a schema into the form-tree structure. Key exports:
- `jsonSchemaToTree(schema)` → Returns a `GroupNode` tree representing the form structure (the JSON Schema front-end; renamed from `parseSchema` per ADR 006)
- `FieldNode` - Leaf nodes representing inputs (widget, validation rules, parts)
- `GroupNode` - Branch nodes representing nested objects (children, query methods)
- `FieldParts`/`GroupParts` - Framework-agnostic render structure descriptors

Tree traversal: Nodes have `walk(handlers)` for recursive traversal with `field` and `group` handlers. Queries (`getField`, `getAllFields`) use **relative paths** from the calling group.

### React Layer (`@formframe/renderer-react`)
- `useFormTree(tree)` → Binds source-agnostic React behavior to a tree from `jsonSchemaToTree`, `zodToTree`, or another front-end; returns `{ form, SchemaFields, submit, … }` (content only — you own the `<form>` + submit, ADR 013/035)
- `SchemaFields` (batteries-included) / `createRenderer` (the public floor that takes a partial renderer set) / `defaultAdapter` + `diagnosticAdapter` (the two built-in renderer sets you spread over) — ADR 013
- Customization is the recursive continuation primitive (ADR 010), re-entered via stable JSX components (ADR 017): `renderNode(node, { Default, Children })` to hijack a node, `<Default of={node}/>` / `<Children of={node}/>` / `<Default of={node.children.x}/>` to re-enter the engine, `<Default of={node} parts={{…}}/>` to override individual field parts (a part is itself a handle: `<Default of={part}/>`). The callables (`node.Default()`) remain the low-level primitive the components delegate to (ADR 016). Fractal from `<SchemaFields>` down to a single part.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **GitHub Issues** (`timkindberg/formframe`) for all issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs.

```bash
gh issue list --state open                    # Check ready work
gh issue create --title "Title" --label "type:feature,p2"
gh issue edit <n> --add-label "in-progress"
gh issue close <n> --reason completed --comment "Done"
```

Legacy bd ids (e.g. `jsonschema-form-bh7`) cited in ADRs map to GitHub numbers in [`scripts/bd-to-github-migration-map.json`](scripts/bd-to-github-migration-map.json).

## Key Design Decisions

- **Core is stateless** - front-ends compile schemas in, consumers (form-state adapters, etc.) fold over the tree to manage values
- **Validation is side-loaded** - pluggable, framework-agnostic, not baked into any layer
- **Form-state is a shallow slot** (ADR 011) - native `<form>`+FormData is the default; RHF/TanStack are optional, justified only by reactivity or interop needs. Validation and UI are the primary swap axes.
- **No "kitchen sink" components** - We provide building blocks, not `<JsonSchemaForm />`
- **"label" not "title"** - Field nodes use `label` for clarity despite JSON Schema using `title`
- **Boolean schemas throw** - `true`/`false` as schema values are not supported

See `architecture_records/` for detailed design rationale. And add new ones when asked.

## Development Philosophy

This project runs as a **verification-gated autonomous loop** (ADR 009) — superseding the earlier strict-pairing philosophy. **Autonomy is bounded by verifiability**: decide alone on anything the gate suite (`npm run gate` = typecheck + lint + test) can catch you getting wrong; propose an ADR and proceed for a new abstraction/seam/public-API change (only once a second implementation forces it — ADR 008); stop and escalate for crossing the stubborn Core boundary, changing the golden-scenario set, adding a heavy dependency, anything that can't be made green, or deleting existing work. See `AGENTS.md` for the full tier breakdown.

**Budget posture:** built on a $20/mo Claude Pro plan. Favor a single agent working against the free gate; use cheaper models for grind; reserve tech-lead/subagent orchestration for large, well-specified chunks; avoid token-multiplying parallel orchestration (Dynamic Workflows / Sandcastle are parked).

Store AI planning documents in `history/` directory, not repo root.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** — `gh issue create` for follow-ups
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) — `npm run gate`
3. **Update issue status** — close finished work, label in-progress items
4. **Push** when the user asks (or when session protocol requires it):
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** — provide context for the next session
